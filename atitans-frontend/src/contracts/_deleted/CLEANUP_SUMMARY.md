## âœ… COMPLETED: Frontend Cleanup

### Removed Files from Frontend (moved to _deleted folder):

- `src/contracts/NegotiableFinBLV1.ts`
- `src/contracts/NegotiableFinBLV2.ts`
- `src/contracts/NegotiableFinBLV2Client.ts`

### Verification Results:
âœ… No import statements found referencing these contracts
âœ… No references found in remaining frontend contract files  
âœ… No references found in components, services, or other frontend code
âœ… Frontend codebase is clean of negotiable BL references

## ðŸ”„ STILL PRESENT: Backend References

### Smart Contract Artifacts (need manual cleanup):
- `smart_contracts/artifacts/negotiable_bl/` directory
- `smart_contracts/artifacts/negotiable_bl_trial/` directory

### Documentation:
- `NEGOTIABLE_BL_TRIAL_REMOVAL.md` file

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps for Complete Cleanup:

1. **Delete Smart Contract Source Files** (if not already done):
   - `smart_contracts/negotiable_bl/`
   - `smart_contracts/negotiable_bl_trial/`
   - `smart_contracts/negotiable_fin_bl_v1/`
   - `smart_contracts/negotiable_fin_bl_v2/`

2. **Clean Compilation Artifacts**:
   ```bash
   # Run the cleanup script we created earlier
   cd C:\\SATHYA\\CHAINAIM3003\\mcp-servers\\altry\\atry2\\atitans1\\projects\\atitans1-contracts
   cleanup_script\\clean_artifacts.bat
   ```

3. **Recompile Clean**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   algokit compile
   ```

## ðŸŽ¯ Result:
Frontend is now completely clean of negotiable BL contract references. 
Only TradeInstrumentRegistryV3 and other active contracts remain.
